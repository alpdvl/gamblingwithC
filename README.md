## General info
A simple gambling games project to improve my skills and knowledge in C.
Note: It relies heavily* on windows specific functions!
	
## Features
* Roulette game
* Coinflip game
* Horse racing game
* Basic text-based animation for each of those games to improve the interaction with users 
* Basic wallet system which includes depositing and withdrawing roul-dollar
* Arrays for showing last rolls and transactions.

## What did i learn
* Char and integer arrays
* Returning multiple values from functions with the help of pointers
* Manipulating arrays for text based animations
* What is system specific functions
* How functions work in C
* How long can variables be accessed for
* Pseudo-Random number generating

* Very basic knowledge for github

## Future of the project
* Planning to add account system with C's file handling
* Improving the last rolls and last transactions and other related aspects of the project with the help of file handling and dynamic memory allocation in C 
* I might add new gambling games
* Optimizing animations and calculations
